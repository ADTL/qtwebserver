# QtWebServer

QtWebServer is an attempt to create a Qt based web application server, ie. a web server that runs native C++/Qt code in order to deliver websites.

# Installation and usage

You can either integrate QtWebServer into your existing application or build a whole standalone web application. There is no distinction between the webserver and the web application, you literally link your web application with your website.

Installation via qt-pods is perfectly suited for this use-case. You can update your QtWebServer version at any time and switch back flawlessly, since it will be embedded as a git submodule. It is not recommended to plain copy the QtWebServer code into your target application. In order to learn more about qt-pods, see here:
